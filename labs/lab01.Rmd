## Due: Thursday, February 1st at 9:00am

## Goals of this lab

1. Practice collecting data.
1. Practice mapping data to a visualization.


## Requirements

* Collect data on some aspect of your life between now and Feb 1st.
    + Pick a time span (e.g., day, week, evening) that aligns well with the data you are collecting.
* Determine how you want to map the data to objects.
* Create three practice sketches.
* On the postcard,
    + Create a visualization of the data on the front.
    + On the back left, create legends so that no additional explanation is needed.
* The target audience is a person with no background in statistics.



## Suggestions

* Reflect on what aspects of your world you might want to better understand through data.
* Collect data on several variables.  Before you collect data, ...
    + It is hard to know what will prove interesting.
    + It is hard to know what will be hard to collect.
* Peruse the ["Dear Data" website](https://www.dear-data.com/all) for ideas.
    + But your postcard must be unique.

## Rubric

When I assess your postcard, I will be looking for:

* The presence of data and a story.
* An appropriate mapping from data to geometric objects.
* How engaging and creative the visualization is.
* How clear, readable, and complete the visualization and legends are.  
* Whether it requires statistical knowledge to understand.
